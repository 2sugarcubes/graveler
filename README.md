# Graveler-rs

My entry into the [ShoddyCast Graveler Softlock Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8C8dHQE2Ro).

## Getting started

1. Download this repository `git clone github.com/2sugarcubes/graveler`
2. Download [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3. Run `make` or `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release`
4. Run `time target/release/graveler` or you may need to do [some powershell magic](https://superuser.com/questions/228056/windows-equivalent-to-unix-time-command) on Windows
5. You are done :)
6. if you want to do more (This didn't do any good for me with my laptop) you can try [PGO](https://github.com/Kobzol/cargo-pgo)

## FAQ

### Why can't I just download an executable

This entry requires specific CPU instructions specific to the CPU on the user's computer, as such an executable generated by me is not likely to work for you, or will not be as fast as it could be if you compiled it on your computer.

### How fast is it?

I got it down to 0.31 seconds on my admittedly weak laptop with all other processes closed and power-save switched off.

The current iteration should benefit greatly from more cores, though that will require editing some code to limit how much it overshoots the target.

#### What did you run it on?

- Model
  - Inspiron 14 7420 2-in-1
- CPU
  - 12th Gen i7-1255U (12 threads)
- Memory
  - 16GB DDR4, 3200 MHz
- OS
  - Arch Linux, Kernel: 6.10.4-arch2-1

## I think I found a speed increase

That's great, first verify with the command `make time` before and after your change, then feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/2sugarcubes/graveler/pulls), or submit [an issue](https://github.com/2sugarcubes/graveler/issues/new) if you need some help with that.
